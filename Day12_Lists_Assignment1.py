#Q1. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list.

# Initialize the list with some numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Initialize a variable to store the sum
total_sum = 0

# Iterate through each number in the list
for number in numbers:
    # Add the current number to the total sum
    total_sum += number

# Print the total sum of the list
print("Sum of all items in the list:", total_sum)

#ANS=> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#ANS=> Sum of all items in the list: 15
